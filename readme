🛠️ How It Works

FAQ Dictionary — All questions and answers are stored in a Python dictionary.
User Input — The user types a question in the chat box.
Matching Logic — The input is converted to lowercase and matched against the FAQ keys (exact match first, then partial match).
Response — The matching answer is displayed. If no match is found, a friendly fallback message is shown.
